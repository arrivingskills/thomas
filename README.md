Positive, Negative, or Zero Counter
Create a list of at least 10 integers (mix of positive, negative, and zero).
Use a for loop to go through each number.
Use if/elif/else to count how many are: positive, negative, and zero.
At the end, print the three counts.

Find the Largest and Smallest Number
Make a list of at least 8 numbers.
Use a for loop to find the largest and smallest numbers without using max() or
min().
Use if statements to update “current max” and “current min” variables.
Print the largest and smallest numbers.

Filter Passing Scores
Create a list of scores (integers from 0 to 100).
Use a for loop to go through each score.
If the score is 50 or above, add it to a new list called passing.
After the loop, print the passing list.

Word Search in a List
Create a list of 8–10 words (your choice).
Ask the user to type a word.
Use a for loop and an if statement to check if the word is in the list.
If found, print "Found!"; otherwise, after the loop, print "Not found.".

Remove Short Words
Create a list of words.
Ask the user for a minimum length (an integer).
Use a for loop and if statements to build a new list containing only the words
with length greater than or equal to the given number.
Print the new list.

Number Guessing Hints (List of Attempts)
Choose a secret number between 1 and 20 (hardcode it in the code).
Create an empty list to store guesses.
Use a for loop that runs up to 5 times (5 attempts).
Each time, ask the user to guess the number and store the guess in the list.
Use if/elif/else to print:
"Too low" if the guess is less than the secret number
"Too high" if greater
"Correct!" if equal (and then stop the loop early if you want)
At the end, print the list of all guesses.

Multiples Filter
Create a list of integers from 1 to 30 (you can either type them or generate
them).
Ask the user for a number n.
Use a for loop and an if statement to print only the numbers in the list that
are multiples of n (i.e., number % n == 0).

Category Labels for Ages
Create a list of ages (integers, e.g., [3, 12, 17, 25, 40, 70]).
Use a for loop to go through each age.
Use if/elif/else to decide:
"Child" for age < 13
"Teen" for 13–17
"Adult" for 18–64
"Senior" for 65+
For each age, print something like "Age 25: Adult".

Vowel Counter in Words List
Create a list of words.
For each word (using a for loop), count how many vowels it has (a, e, i, o, u,
optionally uppercase too).
Use an inner for loop over the letters of the word and an if to check if the
letter is a vowel.
For each word, print the word and its vowel count.

Index of First Even Number
Create a list of integers.
Use a for loop with an index (e.g., for i in range(len(numbers)):).
Use an if statement to find the first even number in the list.
When you find it, print its index and value, then stop checking the rest of the
list.
If no even number is found, print a message like "No even numbers".
